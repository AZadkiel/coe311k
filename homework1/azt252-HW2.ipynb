    "Then, do it for n = 1, 2, 3, 4. I then have to use another function that will space out sin(x) from 0 to 10, however I feel like there a numpy function like that, I think it was linspace, I have used it but I always get errors. I will search up how to deal with it a bit of assistance from online sources. \n",
